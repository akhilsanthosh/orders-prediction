## Overview

Accurate order prediction is crucial for effective supply chain management and operational efficiency. This project utilizes machine learning to predict the number of orders, helping businesses forecast demand and optimize resources.

### Objectives:
1. Process and analyze data related to order history.  
2. Build a robust machine learning model for prediction.  
3. Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.  

---

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.  
- Model Building: Experiments with regression models to achieve high accuracy.  
- Evaluation Metrics: Includes metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the model.
